# Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM)

Few Key takeaways
* The Heath-Jarrow-Morton Model (HJM Model) use a differential equation that incorporates randomness to model forward interest rates.
* These rates are then modeled against an existing interest rate term structure to determine appropriate prices for interest-rate sensitive securities such as bonds or swaps.
* It is now primarily used by arbitrageurs looking for arbitrage opportunities, as well as analysts pricing derivatives.
